# thread-necromancy

This is the source of the Thread Necromancy script for Redbana Forums if anyone wants to continue it.

The data from the original game with everyone's points is in this repository as well.

You'll need:
- to compile it with the MySQL JDBC driver.
- a MySQL database
- PHP, or you'll have to rewrite the update script and scoreboard into something else.  It is not optimized at all, so it's probably a good idea to rewrite it anyway.
